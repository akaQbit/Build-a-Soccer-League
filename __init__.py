Team practice of {team}

{time}, {name} is going to attend the team practice,
I believe your kids gain confidence and a love for the game through positive feedback from coaches, and other players.
Skill level develops at different rates for kids, but effort and having fun can always be achieved.
I try to always provide positive feedback for effort.
